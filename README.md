# Simulation for delay prediction.
        
This repo is based on the paper [Accurate ED Wait Time Prediction by Erjie Ang et Al](https://web.stanford.edu/~bayati/papers/edwait.pdf). We are using simulated data and the model prescribed in the paper to study how wait times can be predicted.         
Further, we are also going to change the linear model to incorporate other ML techniques and hopefully create a better predictor.
